<ol><li>No freight elevator in such building is available for the use described in this section because unique circumstances exist involving substantial safety risks directly related to the use of each such elevator. Such application shall include the reasons for such assertion and supporting documentation; or</li>
<li>There is sufficient secure alternate covered no-cost off-street bicycle parking or sufficient secure alternate indoor no-cost bicycle parking available on the premises or within four blocks or 1,000 feet (304.8 m), whichever is less, of such building to accommodate all tenants or subtenants of such building requesting bicycle access and that such off-street parking is accessible on a 24-hour basis.

<br>
If an exception is sought pursuant to item 1 of this section, the department shall conduct an inspection of the building and each freight elevator and shall thereafter issue a final determination as to whether to grant an exception. If an exception is sought pursuant to item 2 of this section, the department, in consultation with the department of transportation, shall thereafter conduct an inspection of the secure alternate no-cost covered off-street bicycle parking, secure indoor no-cost bicycle parking and the department of transportation shall thereafter issue a final determination as to whether to grant an exception. In either event, a letter of exception or denial shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner, lessee, manager or other person in control of the building. If the exception is denied, a bicycle access plan shall be posted within 20 days after receipt of such determination. Failure to timely post a bicycle access plan shall be cause for the issuance of a violation.
