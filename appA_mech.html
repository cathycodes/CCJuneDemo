NOTE: Each opening shall have a free area of not less than 1 square inch per 1 ,000 Btu per hour of the total input rating of all appliances in the enclosure and not less than 100 square inches.
<br>
For SI: 1 square inch = 645 mm2, 1 British thermal unit per hour = 0.2931 W.

<br>
<br>
NOTE: Each air duct opening shall have a free area of not less than 1 square inch per 2,000 Btu per hour of the total input rating of all appliances in the enclosure. If the appliance room is located against an outside wall and the air openings communicate directly with the outdoors, each opening shall have a free area of not less than 1 square inch per 4,000 Btu per hour or the total input rating of all appliances in the enclosure.
<br>
For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 square inch = 645 mm2, 1 British thermal unit per hour = 0.2931 W.
