It generally is expressed in parts per million by volume (ppm v/v) or milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>). If adequate data do not exist for precise establishment of IDLH concentrations, an independent certified industrial hygienist, industrial toxicologist, appropriate regulatory agency or other source approved by the Fire Commissioner shall make such determination.<br><br><b>LIQUID.</b> A material that has a melting point that is equal to or less than 68&#176;F (20&#176;C) and a boiling point that is greater than 68&#176;F (20&#176;C) at 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) (101 kPa).

The LFL is sometimes referred to as "LEL" or "lower explosive limit."<br><br><b>NORMAL TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE (NTP).</b> A temperature of 70&#176;F (21&#176;C) and a pressure of 1 atmosphere [14.7 psia (101 kPa)].<br><br><b>PHYSIOLOGICAL WARNING THRESHOLD LEVEL.</b> A concentration of air-borne contaminants, normally expressed in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>), that represents the concentration at which persons can sense the presence of the contaminant due to odor, irritation or other quick-acting physiological response. When used in conjunction with the permissible exposure limit (PEL) the physiological warning threshold levels are those consistent with the classification system used to establish the PEL. See the definition of "Permissible exposure limit (PEL)" in the <i>New York City Fire Code</i>.<br><br><b>SERVICE CORRIDOR.</b> A fully enclosed passage other than one designated as a required means of egress, through which HPM can be moved during handling.<br><br><b>SOLID.</b> A material that has a melting point, decomposes or sublimates at a temperature greater than 68&#176;F (20&#176;C).<br><br><b>WORKSTATION.</b> A defined space within a fabrication area in which a specific function, laboratory procedure or research activity relating to semiconductor manufacture is conducted.
