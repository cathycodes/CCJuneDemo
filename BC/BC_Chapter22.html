For the purpose of this provision, a connection shall be considered compliant if it meets the following requirements:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type:none"><li>3.1. For single-plate shear connections, the available tensile strength shall be determined only for the limit state of bolt bearingon the plate and beam web.</li>
<li>3.2. For single angle and double angle shear connections, the available tensile strength shall be determined for the limit states of bolt bearing on the angles and beam web and for tension yielding on the gross area of the angles.</li>
<li>3.3. All other connections shall be designed for the required tension force noted above in accordance with the provisions of AISC 360, or AISC-HSS.</li></ol>
<li>4. For the purpose of satisfying these integrity provisions only, bearing bolts in connections with short-slotted holes parallel to the direction of the tension force and inelastic deformation are permitted.  Elements and their connections that brace compression members shall have a minimum available tensile strength equal to at least 2 percent of the required compressive strength of the member being braced, but not less than 10 kips (45 kN). For design of these bracing connections, the shear force and the tensile force need not be considered to act simultaneously. Where more than one element braces a compression member at a point in one direction, all elements and connections shall have a minimum available tensile strength equal to at least 1 percent of the required compressive strength of the member being braced but not less than 10 kips (45 kN).</li></ol>

<ol><li>Shear studs shall not be less than &#189; inch (12.7 mm) in diameter. The spacing of shear studs shall not be greater than one every 12 inches (305 mm) averaged over the length of the beam.</li>
<li>Connections at the discontinuous edges of permanent metal decking to supporting members shall have a minimum connection strength in the direction parallel to the rib of the deck equal to the shear strength of a &#190;-inch (19.1 mm) puddle weld every 12 inches (305 mm) on center.</li>
<li>Side lap connections of permanent metal decking shall have a minimum strength equal to the strength of a button punch every 24 inches (610 mm) on center.</li>
<li>Welded wire fabric reinforcement in concrete slabs shall be continuous over all supports and in all spans. Minimum area of continuous reinforcement shall be 0.0015 times the area of concrete. The welded wire fabric reinforcement shall have tension splices and be anchored at discontinuous edges.</li></ol>
