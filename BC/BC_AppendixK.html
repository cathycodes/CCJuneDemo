<br><br><b>1 SCOPE</b>
<br><br><b>Delete and revise the text of Section 1 to read as follows:</b>
<br><br>This standard applies to the design, construction, installation, maintenance, inspection, and operation of conveyors and conveying systems in relation to hazards. The conveyors may be of the bulk material, package, or unit handling types where the installation is designed for permanent, temporary, or portable operation.
<br><br>This standard shall apply, with the exceptions noted below, to all conveyor installations.
<br><br>This standard specifically excludes any conveyor designed for, installed for, or used for the movement of human beings. This standard does, however, apply to certain conveying devices that incorporate within their supporting structure, work stations or operator's stations specifically designed for authorized personnel.
<br><br>This standard does not apply to conveyors such as underground mine conveyors for which specific standards are already in effect, or to equipment such as industrial trucks, tractors, trailers, automatic guided vehicles, tiering machines (except pallet load tierers), cranes, hoists, power shovels, power scoops, bucket drag lines, trenchers, platform elevators designed to carry passengers or operator, manlifts, moving walks, moving stairways (escalators), highway or railroad vehicles, cableways, tramways, dumbwaiters, pneumatic conveyors, robots or integral machine transfer devices. Some of the foregoing have specific standards.
