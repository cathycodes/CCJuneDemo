<br><br><b>EXPANDED VINYL WALL COVERING.</b> Wall covering consisting of a woven textile backing, an expanded vinyl base coat layer and a non-expanded vinyl skin coat. The expanded base coat layer is a homogeneous vinyl layer that contains a blowing agent. During processing, the blowing agent decomposes, causing this layer to expand by forming closed cells. The total thickness of the wall covering is approximately 0.055 inch to 0.070 inch (1.4 mm to 1.8 mm).
<br><br><b>FLAME SPREAD.</b> The propagation of flame over a surface.
<br><br><b>FLAME SPREAD INDEX.</b> A comparative measure, expressed as a dimensionless number, derived from visual measurements of the spread of flame versus time for a material tested in accordance with ASTM E 84.
<br><br><b>INTERIOR FINISH.</b> Interior finish includes interior wall and ceiling finish and interior floor finish.
<br><br><b>INTERIOR FLOOR FINISH.</b> The exposed floor surfaces of buildings including coverings applied over a finished floor or stair, including risers.
<br><br><b>INTERIOR FLOOR-WALL BASE.</b> Interior floor finish trim used to provide a functional and/or decorative border at the intersection of walls and floors.
<br><br><b>INTERIOR WALL AND CEILING FINISH.</b> The exposed interior surfaces of buildings including, but not limited to: fixed or movable walls and partitions; toilet room privacy partitions; columns; ceilings; and interior wainscoting, paneling or other finish applied structurally or for decoration, acoustical correction, surface insulation, structural fire resistance or similar purposes, but not including trim.
<br><br><b>SITE-FABRICATED STRETCH SYSTEM.</b> A system, fabricated on site and intended for acoustical, tackable or aesthetic purposes, that is comprised of three elements: (a) a frame (constructed of plastic, wood, metal or other material) used to hold fabric in place, (b) a core material (infill, with the correct properties for the application), and (c) an outside layer, comprised of a textile, fabric or vinyl, that is stretched taut and held in place by tension or mechanical fasteners via the frame.
<br><br><b>SMOKE-DEVELOPED INDEX.</b> A comparative measure, expressed as a dimensionless number, derived from measurements of smoke obscuration versus time for a material tested in accordance with ASTM E 84.
<br><br><b>TRIM.</b> Picture molds, chair rails, baseboards, handrails, door and window frames and similar decorative or protective materials used in fixed applications.
