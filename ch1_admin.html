Such means and methods shall be described with particularity and in no case shall terms such as “code complaint,” “approved,” “legal,” “protected in accordance with law” or similar terms be used as substitute for such description. The tenant protection plan must be site specific. The elements of the tenant protection plan may vary depending on the nature and scope of the work but at a minimum, must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the New York city construction codes, the New York city housing maintenance code, the New York city noise control code and the New York city health code, and shall make detailed and specific provisions for:

<li><b>Structural safety.</b> No structural work shall be done that may endanger the occupants.</li>
<li><b>Noise restrictions.</b> Specifications of means and methods to be used for the limitation of noise to acceptable levels in accordance with the New York city noise control code shall be included. Where hours of the day or the days of the week in which construction work may be undertaken are limited pursuant to the New York city noise control code, such limitations shall be stated.</li>
<li>
<b>Maintaining essential services.</b> Where heat, hot water, cold water, gas, electricity, or other utility services are provided in such building or in any dwelling unit located therein, the tenant protection plan shall specify the means and methods to be used for maintaining such services during such work in accordance with the requirements of the New York city housing maintenance code. If a disruption of any such service is anticipated during the work, then such plan shall specify the anticipated duration of such disruption and the means and methods to be employed to minimize such disruption, including the provision of sufficient alternatives for such service during such disruption. Notification of the disruption must be given to all affected occupants of occupied dwelling units.
