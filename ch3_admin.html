<ol style="list-style-type:none"><li>1. Such an adjustment may be granted upon a specific determination that all of the following conditions in items 1.1 through 1.3 are met:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type:none"><li>1.1. Capital improvements are necessary for strict compliance with the limit set forth in <a class="sectionRef" href="#AC320.3">section 28-320.3</a> and it is not reasonably possible to make such improvements due to (i) a constraint imposed by another provision of law, including but not limited to designation as a landmark, landmark site, interior landmark, or within a historic district pursuant to chapter 3 of title 25 of the administrative code, or (ii) a physical condition of the building or building site, including but not limited to lack of access to energy infrastructure, space constraints, or lack of access to a space within a building covered by a lease in existence on the effective date of this section;</li>
<li>1.2. The owner has made a good faith effort to purchase greenhouse gas offsets to comply with <a class="sectionRef" href="#AC320.3">section 28-320.3</a> but a sufficient quantity is not available at a reasonable cost; and</li>
<li>1.3. The owner has availed itself of all available city, state, federal, private and utility incentive programs related to energy reduction or renewable energy for which it reasonably could participate.</li></ol>
