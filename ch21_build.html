Reinforcement provided for one requirement may be counted towards the other requirements.<br><br><div id="BC2114.2" name="BC2114.2"><b>2114.2 Continuity and ties.</b></div><br>Load-bearing masonry structures shall be reinforced to obtain a continuous system of vertical and horizontal ties. Continuity of all ties shall be ensured by providing lap, welded or mechanical tension splices.
