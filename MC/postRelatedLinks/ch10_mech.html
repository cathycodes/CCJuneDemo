 Upon completion of the assembly and installation of boilers and pressure vessels, acceptance tests shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the <i>ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code</i>. Boilers shall not be placed in operation upon completion of construction until they have been inspected and tested and a certificate of compliance has been issued by the commissioner. All final inspections and tests for boilers shall be made by a qualified boiler inspector in the employ of the department or a duly authorized insurance company as provided in Section 204 of the <i>Labor Law of the State of New York</i>. Equipment having an input of not more than 350,000 Btu/h (103 kW) shall be exempt from this requirement. Where field assembly of pressure vessels or boilers is required, a copy of the completed H-2, P-2 or U-1 Manufacturer's Data Report and the completed Appendix C of ASME CSD-1 required by the <i>ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code</i> shall be submitted to the department
