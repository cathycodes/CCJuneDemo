Assemblies may include glass, metal, precast concrete or masonry elements arranged so as not to exert common action under load and to move independently of each other and the supporting structure.<br><br><b>EXTERIOR INSULATION AND FINISH SYSTEMS (EIFS).</b> EIFS are nonstructural, nonload-bearing, exterior wall cladding systems that consist of an insulation board attached either adhesively or mechanically, or both, to the substrate, an integrally reinforced base coat and a textured protective finish coat.<br><br><b>EXTERIOR INSULATION AND FINISH SYSTEMS (EIFS) WITH DRAINAGE.</b> An EIFS that incorporates a means of drainage applied over a water-resistive barrier.<br><br><b>EXTERIOR WALL.</b> A wall, bearing or nonbearing, that is used as an enclosing wall for a building, other than a fire wall, and that has a slope of 60 degrees (1.05 rad) or greater with the horizontal plane.<br><br><b>EXTERIOR WALL COVERING.</b> A material or assembly of materials applied on the exterior side of exterior walls for the purpose of providing a weather-resisting barrier, insulation or for aesthetics, including but not limited to, veneers, siding, exterior insulation and finish systems, architectural trim and embellishments such as cornices, soffits, facias, gutters and leaders.<br><br><b>EXTERIOR WALL ENVELOPE.</b> A system or assembly of exterior wall components, including exterior wall finish materials, that provides protection of the building structural members, including framing and sheathing materials, and conditioned interior space, from the detrimental effects of the exterior environment.<br><br><b>FIBER CEMENT SIDING.</b> A manufactured, fiber-reinforcing product made with an inorganic hydraulic or calcium silicate binder formed by chemical reaction and reinforced with discrete organic or inorganic nonasbestos fibers, or both. Additives that enhance manufacturing or product performance are permitted. Fiber cement siding products have either smooth or textured faces and are intended for exterior wall and related applications.<br><br><b>FLY-THROUGH CONDITIONS.</b> One or more panels of glass that provide a clear line of sight through such elements creating the illusion of a void leading to the other side, including parallel glass elements, at a distance of 17 feet (5182 mm) or less, or a convergence of glass sides creating a perpendicular, acute or obtuse corner.<br><br><b>METAL COMPOSITE MATERIAL (MCM).</b> A factory-manufactured panel consisting of metal skins bonded to both faces of a plastic core.<br><br><b>METAL COMPOSITE MATERIAL (MCM) SYSTEM.</b> An exterior wall covering fabricated using MCM in a specific assembly including joints, seams, attachments, substrate, framing and other details as appropriate to a particular design.<br><br><b>VENEER.</b> A facing attached to a wall for the purpose of providing ornamentation, protection or insulation, but not counted as adding strength to the wall. Veneers are nonstructural in that they do not carry any load other than their own weight.<br><br><b>VINYL SIDING.</b> A shaped material, made principally from rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that is used as an exterior wall covering.<br><br><b>WATER-RESISTIVE BARRIER.</b> A material behind an exterior wall covering that is intended to resist liquid water that has penetrated behind the exterior wall covering from further intruding into the exterior wall assembly.<br><br><div class="legHistory">Legislative History:</div><a class="legHistory" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/local_laws/ll15of2020.pdf" target="_blank">Local Law 15/20</a><br class="legHistory"><a class="legHistory" href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/local_laws/ll141of2013.pdf" target="_blank">Local Law 141/13 (2014 Code Revision Cycle)</a><br class="legHistory"><div id="BC1403" name="BC1403"><b>SECTION BC 1403<br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS</b></div><br><div class="bulletin">Buildings Bulletins:</div><a class="bulletin" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/bldgs_bulletins/bb_2014-022.pdf" target="_blank">2014-022: Acceptance criteria for porcelain tile ventilated façade systems</a><br class="bulletin"><br class="spacer"><div id="BC1403.1" name="BC1403.1"><b>1403.1 General.</b></div><br>The provisions of this section shall apply to exterior walls, exterior wall coverings and components thereof.<br><br><br class="spacer"><div id="BC1403.2" name="BC1403.2"><b>1403.2 Weather protection.</b></div><br>Exterior walls shall provide the building with a weather-resistant exterior wall envelope.
